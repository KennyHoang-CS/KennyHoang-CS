### <bold>Hi there, I'm Kenny Hoang.</bold> ðŸ‘‹

###### My interest for coding took off in high school when I took an 'Introduction to Programming' course. I programmed Lego robots to dance and using the 'Alice Software' to animate 3D models to do a music video reenactment of Michael Jackson's Thriller.

###### I have worked in a high-paced environment of the fast-food industry, 4+ years at McDonald's. Fast-food industries are highly notorious for their high turnover rates because they're a high performing environment in both mentally and physically. But not me, I persevered, and through that perseverance, I take those traits into coding.

###### McDonald's has embodied in me the skills: communication, customer-focused, multitasking, and team mentality. After obtaining a B.S. degree in Computer Science, I jumped straight into a specialization boot camp at Springboard. At Springboard, I have learned the latest technologies used in Full-Stack Development with real-world applications consisting of frontend and backend development, Python, Flask, SQL, Node and Express, React, and Redux along with other tools. I have both the computer science theories and the practical software engineering skills.

###### Technologies I do not know, I do know that I have the ability to learn and adapt to be successful anywhere due to having a growth mindset. In both of my studies, I have traits of being determined, persistent, achieving time and priority management while working a part-time job to meet objectives. I am teachable with an attitude to learn quickly in execution. </code>
